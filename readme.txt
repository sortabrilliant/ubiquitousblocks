Let's make reusable blocks even easier to reuse.

== Description ==
Reusable blocks are great but we wanted to make them even better. What if you could add a reusable block to every post/page with only a few clicks. You can with Ubiquitous Blocks.

#### How does this work?
We added a top level menu item for reusable blocks making them easier to access. We then added controls to the reusable block editor that allow you set which post types these blocks will be added to and their position.

#### I like this, who made it?
This plugin is brought to you by [sorta brilliant](https://sortabrilliant.com/) and [block garden](https://block.garden).
